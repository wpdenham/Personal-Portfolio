							Welcome! Thanks for stopping in. Most know me as Bill, and I am a Chicago based Front-End Developer with a strong passion for bringing ideas to life through the powerful combination of code and design.  As a self-taught developer, I have come to appreciate just how complex this environment can be and I thrive on being able to apply my prior design knowledge to a new field in an effort to truly bring projects from concept to completion.
